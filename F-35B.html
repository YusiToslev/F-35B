            <h2>Role</h2>

                <div class="paragraph-box">
                    <p>The Lightning is a stealth aircraft operating alongside the Typhoon.
                        A multi-role machine, Lightning is capable of conducting air-to-surface, electronic warfare,
                        intelligence gathering and air-to-air missions simultaneously.
                    </p>
                </div>

            <h2>Capability</h2>

                <div class="paragraph-box">
                    <p>The aircraft combines advanced sensors and mission systems with low observable technology, 
                        or ‘stealth’, which enables it to operate undetected in hostile airspace. 
                        Its integrated sensors, sensor fusion and data linking provide the pilot with unprecedented situational awareness. 
                        The pilot is able to share information gathered by the jet with other platforms using secure data links, 
                        and/or use the information to employ weapons or electronic means.  

                        The Lightning’s short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) capability allows it to operate from the new ‘Queen Elizabeth’-class aircraft carriers and the vessels of allied nations, 
                        as well as short airstrips.
